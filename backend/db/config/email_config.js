// Ticket No. 110624-002 - [stock transfer] add date in stock transfer

// Ticket No. 110724-001 - Slow Loading Due to Large Data Volume
// Ticket No. 110724-002 - Remove the Rejected in BIS
// Ticket No. 110724-003 - Add a filter to the Issuance module to allow filtering for any unapproved issuances. This will make it easier to identify records that have not been approved.
// Ticket No. 110724-004 - even without selecting "Accountability," the accountability reference code is still generated, causing duplicate issuances. Additionally, some issuances lack an accountability number and MRS number, making it difficult to trace the issuance number. This concern is specifically affecting the accountability report for Coter, Nicolas L. Jr.â€”his name does not appear when attempting to click on his record.
